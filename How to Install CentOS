How to install CentOS into your new computer:

when you first see the computer powering up, go crazy with the f12 key
untill you see on the uper right corner "boot menu" or something like that.

Hopefully you have the CentOS in your Thumb Drive from my "How to DD"


go to Anaconda (don't laugh it is a real thing) [you laughed, didn't you?]
{Install to Hard Drive}

Set your time zone to Americas, Vancouver (there is no other cities 
within the Washington area available for the settings.

go choose your disk (bottom left)

pick the first hard drive (A.K.A. sda1)
if there is little to no free space for the installment, then you may
not have done the Gparted process.
if you did do the Gparted process and it still won't work, manually
remove the data in the hard drive by choosing to change participants

press done and you will get a menu

delete all files by choosing the file and pressing the "-" icon next
to the "+" icon

then press the "+" and type /boot then type 1gib

change the file type to ext3

and update it at the bottom right cornor

do the same process but type swap and 16gib keep the file the same

one more time but just type "/" that is root then type 200gib

change the file to ext4 and update

say done

go to host name and choose your host name you want to make.

go to wired, click the option "gear" icon

select IPv4 and change the address manually and press "apply"

now press install on the Anaconda at the bottom right corner

there will be a username and password and root password
change the username and password, root password has to be the class's password

then wait for the installation and press ok to complete it and reboot to apply all changes.
