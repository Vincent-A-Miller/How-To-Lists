So you want to Gpart your Hard Drive:

enter root (will not work if you are not in root)

#yum install gparted
(if not able)
yum -y install epel-release

then try #5 again.

unless you can't use it on CentOS:

then you need a SCD from Mr. Coleman

Power off and turn it back on

wait for the booting up and press f12 untill boot menu

choose CD

choose x64 basic rescue then vestra     (I forgot the process)

to delete data on your hard drive:

select any undesired data and press the "x" in the cirlce and say delete.

then press the green check mark icon to apply and there is no need to save it.
