How to Delete an Existing Website on Github:

go into each file

press the trash icon

click on commit changes

hopefully you have the file from the ttcyber repo (download here)

when you emptied out all the files, go to upload files.

the file limit to insert is 100 files. so i recommend doing few files at a time.

when you have the partial files inserted, click the commit change and do this 
process again about two more times.
